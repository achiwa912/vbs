* Vocabull (server)

* Overview
[[https://github.com/achiwa912/vbs][Vocabull (server)]] is a better flashcard web application for your vocabulary building.  It has three modes:
1. Flashcard - word \to definition
2. Flashcard - definition \to word
3. Type words from the definitions

I believe it is better than simple flashcards because:
- You'll see hard-to-memorize words more frequently
  - It repeats small number of words until you memorize (for now)
- You can practice spelling (type-word mode)
- Vocabull pronounces words for you
- You can practice anywhere at anytime with your mobile phone, tablet or PC
- Presents words in random order

** How Vocabull works
- Vocabull randomly presents to you words that have the lowest "memorized" score
- Vocabull keeps track of 10 recent unfamiliar words that you are working on
- You'll see these 10 words repeatedly until you "memorize" them for now
- You'll see memorized words again after the entire words are memorized for the round
- You can skip known words for five entire rounds; or, you can remove the words

* Quick Start
** Register and login
- You can try [[https://achiwa912.pythonanywhere.com]]
- Click the menu icon at the top right corner > =Login= > =Click here to register=
- Register your account
- Login

** Choose a sample book
- At first, a sample book (ie, sample_<your_user_name>) is registered and it has 5 words in it
[[./images/vbs_samplebook.jpg]]

- Click the sample book

** Practice flashcards
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =word to def= or =def to word=
  - You will be navigated to the practice page
[[./images/vbs_samplewords.jpg]]
- Click the word card to flip and show the answer
  - Orange card shows the word, and blue card shows the definition
  - You can flip cards as many as you like
[[./images/vbs_w2d.jpg]]
- Click =Pronounce word= to check the pronunciation
- If you don't know, click =Once more= so that the word will reappear in the near future
- If you managed to memorize it, click =Memorized for now= to increase the score by 1
  - You won't see the word for this round as Vocabull presents to you 10-lowest-score words
- If you know the word, click =Knew it!= to increase the score by 5!
  - So, you won't see the word for 5 rounds
- Click =Back to book= to go back to the selected book

** Practice type spells
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =type word=
- Vocabull shows the definition of a word and asks you to type the word
[[./images/vbs_type.jpg]]
- Type your answer and click =Submit= (or push =return= key)
- It shows correct/incorrect and asks you to type the word 4 times, anyway
  - Tip: use =tab= or =return= key to move from an input box to another
  - If incorrect, you'll see the word again after a while
  - Click =Pronounce word= to check the pronunciation
[[./images/vbs_repeat.jpg]]
- It moves to the next word

** Create a book and add words
Also, you can create your own book and register words.

- Click My Books > =Add= button
- Type a book name, language to pronounce and click =Submit=
  - The language code will be used to pronounce words
  - It can be en-US (English (USA)), fr-FR (French (France)), etc. and default to en-US
  - Language code list here: [[http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm]]
  - Note: your browser might not support some languages
- Click the newly created book card > click =Add word=
- Type word and definition, and then click =Submit= \to Now, =Practice= is activated
  - Add a few words

** Optionally, you can load words from file
- Prepare a word definition file
  - one word definition per line
  - a line consists of =word=, =definition= and an optional =sample sentence= separated by a tab (\t)
  - a line format (=\t= is a tab):
#+begin_src 
<word>\t<definition>[\t<sample>]
#+end_src
- Example:
#+begin_src 
strident	shrill, harsh, rough	[in more ******** tones]
lassitude	weariness, fatigue	[a feeling of *********]
deleterious	bad, harmful	[a *********** effect on health]
#+end_src
- Navigate to a book page
- Click =Load from file= > click =Browse...= > choose a file > click =Submit=

** Read it aloud! feature (experimental)
I recently added a new feature, =Read it aloud!= Vocabull reads aloud words and/or sentences. I think it is a convenient feature if you are a non-native English learner. 

[[./images/vbs_readaloud.jpg]]

- On the top page, you'll see Read it aloud! area under My Books book list.
- In the textbox, type (or copy&paste) English word(s) or sentence(s)
- Click Submit button
- You are navigated to a black page with audio control, and it reads aloud what you entered
- You need to use browser's back button to go back to the page (hopefully, I'd like to fix this soonâ€¦)

Noticed that google-text-to-speech API limits its usage at up to 100 requests per day, which is very low.  I might want to remove this feature in the future.

** Backup and restore (new)
As Vocabull is still being developed, there's some risk that your data is all deleted and lost.  For example, a bug could corrupt the database.  To address such a scenario, I have implemented =Export all= and =Import and restore= features, which enable you to backup/restore your books and practice progress to a local file.

=Export all= exports all your books, all words in them and scores to a JSON file.

=Import and restore= reads the backup JSON file and restores books, words and scores.  If there's an existing book of the same name, it will add words to the existing book.  If the same word is in the book, it will overwrite the definition and sample sentence from the backup.  For scores, larger values remain.

For example, if you =Export all= and then =Import and restore= right after, nothing will change in your books, words or scores.

*** How to backup
- On the top page, scroll down until you see Backup and restore section.
- Click =Export all= to save your books and progress to a local file named =vocabull.json=

*** How to restore
- On the top page, scroll down until you see Backup and restore section.
- click =Import and restore= button
- Click =Browse...= and choose =vocabull.json=, and then click =Submit=

* Setup server
- Setup Python 3.11 or later
- git clone repository
: git clone https://github.com/achiwa912/vbs.git
or
: git clone git@github.com:achiwa912/vbs.git
- create virtual environment (recommended)
#+begin_src bash
cd vbs
python -m venv ve
./ve/bin/activate
#+end_src
- Install prerequisites
: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Set environment variables if you use Flask's development web server
#+begin_src bash
export FLASK_APP=vbs.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1  # optional
#+end_src
- Initial setup
: flask initial-setup
- Run app
: flask run
or use a proper web server
