* Vocabull (server)

* Overview
[[https://github.com/achiwa912/vbs][Vocabull (server)]] is a flashcard web application for your vocabulary building.  It has three modes:
1. Flashcard - word \to definition
2. Flashcard - definition \to word
3. Type words from the definitions

** How Vocabull works
- Vocabull keeps track of 10 recent unfamiliar words that you are working on
- You'll see these 10 words repeatedly until you "memorize" them for now
- You'll see memorized words again after the entire words are memorized for the round
- You can skip known words for five entire rounds; or, you can remove the words

* Quick Start
*** Register and login
- Visit =localhost:5000= or a URL on which Vocabull is served
- Click the menu icon at the top right corner > =Login= > =Click here to register=
- Register your account
- Login

*** Create a book
- Click My Books > =Add= button
- Type a book name and click =Submit=

*** Choose book and add words
- Click the newly created book card
- Click =Add word=
- Type word and definition, and then click =Submit= \to Now, =Practice= is activated
- Add a few more words

*** Optionally, you can load words from file
- Prepare a word definition file
  - one word definition per line
  - a line consists of =word=, =definition= and an optional =sample sentense= separated by a tab (\t)
  - a line format (=\t= is a tab):
#+begin_src 
<word>\t<definition>[\t<sample>]
#+end_src
- Example:
#+begin_src 
strident	shrill, harsh, rough	[in more ******** tones]
lassitude	weariness, fatigue	[a feeling of *********]
deleterious	bad, harmful	[a *********** effect on health]
#+end_src
- Navigate to a book page
- Click =Load from file= > click =Browse...= > choose a file > click =Submit=

*** Practice flashcards
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =word to def= or =def to word=
  - You will be navigated to the practice page
- Click left/right edge of the word card to flip and show the answer
  - Orange card shows the word, and blue card shows the definition
  - You can flip cards as many as you like
- If you don't know, click =Once more= so that the word will reappear in the near future
- If you managed to memorize it, click =Memorized for now= to increase the score by 1
  - You won't see the word for this round as Vocabull presents to you 10-lowest-score words
- If you know the word, click =Knew it!= to increase the score by 5!
- Click =Back to book= to go back to the selected book

*** Practice type spells
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =type word=
- Vocabull shows the definition of a word and asks you to type the word
- Type your answer and click =Submit= (or push =return= key)
- It shows corret/incorrect and asks you to type the word 4 times, anyway
  - Tip: use =tab= or =return= key to move from an input box to another
  - If incorrect, you'll see the word again after a while
- It moves to the next word
