* Vocabull (server)

* Overview
[[https://github.com/achiwa912/vbs][Vocabull (server)]] is a flash card web application for your vocabulary building.  It will have three modes:
1. Flash cards - word \to definition
2. Flash cards - definition \to word
3. Type words from the definitions (coming soon)

** How Vocabull works
- Vocabull keeps track of 10 recent unfamiliar words that you are working on
- You'll see these 10 words repeatedly until you "memorize" them for now
- You'll see memorized words again after the entire words are memorized
- You can skip known words (to you) for five entire rounds; or, you can remove the words

* Quick Start
*** Register and login
- Visit =localhost:5000= or a URL on which Vocabull is served
- Click the menu icon at the top right corner > =Login= > =Click here to register=
- Register your account
- Login

*** Create a book
- Click My Books > =Add= button
- Type a book name and click =Submit=

*** Choose book and start practicing
- Click the newly created book card
- Click =Add word=
- Type word and definition, and then click =Submit= \to Now, =Practice= is activated
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =word to def= or =def to word=
  - You will be navigated to the practice page

*** Practice
- Click left/right edge of the word card to flip and show the answer
  - Orange card shows the word, and blue card shows the definition
  - You can flip cards as many as you like
- If you don't know, click =Once more= so that the word will reappear in the near future
- If you managed to memorize it, click =Memorized for now= to increase the score by 1
- If you know the word, click =Knew it!= to increase the score by 5!
- Click =Back to book= to go back to the selected book
