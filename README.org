* Vocabull (server)

* Overview
[[https://github.com/achiwa912/vbs][Vocabull (server)]] is a better flashcard web application for your vocabulary building.  It has three modes:
1. Flashcard - word \to definition
2. Flashcard - definition \to word
3. Type words from the definitions

I believe it is better than simple flashcards because:
- You'll see hard-to-memorize words more frequently
  - It repeats small number of words until you memorize (for now)
- You can practice anywhere at anytime with your mobile phone, tablet or PC
- You can practice spelling (type-word mode)
- Presents words in random order

** How Vocabull works
- Vocabull randomly present to you words that have the lowest "memorized" score
- Vocabull keeps track of 10 recent unfamiliar words that you are working on
- You'll see these 10 words repeatedly until you "memorize" them for now
- You'll see memorized words again after the entire words are memorized for the round
- You can skip known words for five entire rounds; or, you can remove the words

* Quick Start
** Register and login
- You can try [[https://achiwa912.pythonanywhere.com]]
- Click the menu icon at the top right corner > =Login= > =Click here to register=
- Register your account
- Login

** Choose a sample book
- At first, a sample book (ie, sample_<your_user_name>) is registerd and it has 5 words in it
[[./images/vbs_samplebook.jpg]]

- Click the sample book

** Practice flashcards
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =word to def= or =def to word=
  - You will be navigated to the practice page
[[./images/vbs_samplewords.jpg]]
- Click the word card to flip and show the answer
  - Orange card shows the word, and blue card shows the definition
  - You can flip cards as many as you like
[[./images/vbs_w2d.jpg]]
- Click =Pronounce word= to check the pronounciation
  - A small pop-up will open for a few sec and it will automatically close
- If you don't know, click =Once more= so that the word will reappear in the near future
- If you managed to memorize it, click =Memorized for now= to increase the score by 1
  - You won't see the word for this round as Vocabull presents to you 10-lowest-score words
- If you know the word, click =Knew it!= to increase the score by 5!
  - So, you won't see the word for 5 rounds
- Click =Back to book= to go back to the selected book

** Practice type spells
- Click =Practice= menu > choose =type word=
- Vocabull shows the definition of a word and asks you to type the word
[[./images/vbs_type.jpg]]
- Type your answer and click =Submit= (or push =return= key)
- It shows corret/incorrect and asks you to type the word 4 times, anyway
  - Tip: use =tab= or =return= key to move from an input box to another
  - If incorrect, you'll see the word again after a while
  - Click =Pronunce word= to check the pronunciation
[[./images/vbs_repeat.jpg]]
- It moves to the next word

** Create a book and add words
Also, you can create your own book and register words.

- Click My Books > =Add= button
- Type a book name and click =Submit=
- Click the newly created book card > click =Add word=
- Type word and definition, and then click =Submit= \to Now, =Practice= is activated
  - Add a few words

** Optionally, you can load words from file
- Prepare a word definition file
  - one word definition per line
  - a line consists of =word=, =definition= and an optional =sample sentense= separated by a tab (\t)
  - a line format (=\t= is a tab):
#+begin_src 
<word>\t<definition>[\t<sample>]
#+end_src
- Example:
#+begin_src 
strident	shrill, harsh, rough	[in more ******** tones]
lassitude	weariness, fatigue	[a feeling of *********]
deleterious	bad, harmful	[a *********** effect on health]
#+end_src
- Navigate to a book page
- Click =Load from file= > click =Browse...= > choose a file > click =Submit=

** Read it aloud! feature (new)
I recently added a new feature, =Read it aloud!= Vocabull reads aloud words and/or sentences. I think it is a convenient feature if you are a non-native English learner. 

[[./images/vbs_readaloud.jpg]]

- On the top page, you'll see Read it aloud! area under My Books book list.
- In the textbox, type (or copy&paste) English word(s) or sentence(s)
- Click Submit button
- You are navigated to a black page with audio control, and it reads aloud what you entered
- You need to use browser's back button to go back to the page (hopefully, I'd like to fix this soonâ€¦)
